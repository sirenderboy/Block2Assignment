# Program Purpose and Motivation
This is a very simple Ceaser Cipher Encryptor that can be used in a variety of text based encryption methods. It can be called from the command line and utilized to encrypt and decrypt strings on the go without unnecessary compilation or runtime overhead. When I was going about this project initially, I wanted to utilize this in one of my side projects that heavily relies on raw JSON data, and thus, I wanted to make something I could easily utilize within that context.

# Installation
Simply download Encrypter.py from the repository

# Usage
1. Navigate to the folder containing Encrypter.py

2. In the cmd line, utilize the following command:
   ./Encrypter.py (string to encrypt/decrypt) (the number of letters to shift the string) (0 for encrypt, 1 for decrypt)

# Usage Limitations
The following program should be used by program developers in order to encrypt data for travel. It should not be used by other unauthorized users for the purpose of decrypting data they do not own.

# Responsible Use Statement

Due to the open nature of this security tool, ethical considerations in regards to bad actors manipulating this encryption tool in order to hijack data from legitimate users should be noted. Should the cipher amount be discovered, it can be easily decrypted. As such, this should be used in conjunction with other, more prominent decryption techniques.
