This is a very simple Ceaser Cipher Encryptor that can be used in a variety of text based encryption methods. When I was going about this project initially, I wanted to utilize this in one of my side projects that heavily relies on raw JSON data, and thus, I wanted to make something I could easily utilize within that context.

The program can be run from the command line via invocation of the file name after JFLKASJFLKASJFLKASJFKLASJFKLASJFLKASJFLKJASLKFJASLKFJaskLj

Due to the open nature of this security tool, ethical considerations in regards to bad actors manipulating this encryption tool in order to hijack data from legitimate users should be noted. The program has no dependencies and is workable out of the box. It should be used by program developers in order to encrypt data for travel and decrypt it client side. It should not be used by other unauthorized users for the purpose of decrypting data they do not own. Should the cipher amount be discovered, it can be easily decrypted. As such, this should be used in conjunction with other, more prominent decryption techniques.
